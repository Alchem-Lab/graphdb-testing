1. MTGL

1.1 Installing MTGL

MTGL follows the standard installation method of Unix-like systems.  For those
unfamiliar with this, the short version is to issue the following commands
from the root MTGL directory:

  ./configure --prefix=<mtgl_install_dir>
  make install

If you are an administrator and want to install in the default location
(/usr/local), then don't include the '--prefix' option.  Note that nothing
actually happens in the make step because the library is just a bunch of
header files that need to be copied.

1.2 Building the tests and tutorials

The MTGL includes some tests of its algorithms.  The tests show examples
of using the algorithms in the MTGL and allow testing of the algorithms
and data structures.  The MTGL also includes some tutorial files.  Building
the tests or tutorials is not a required step to utilize the MTGL as a
library.  In fact, building the tests and tutorials takes quite a while on
the XMT, so you probably don't want to build unless you need to.

The tests are located in the test/ subdirectory of the checkout.  The
tutorials are located in the tutorial/ subdirectory of the checkout.  There
are three targets for building the tests and tutorials:

  buildtests    Make the standard tests.
  buildall      Make all the tests.
  tutorial      Make the tutorial programs.

Run

  make <target>

from the main directory of the checkout to build the chosen target.

To build an individual test or tutorial, run

  make <file_prefix>

from the appropriate subdirectory, where <file_prefix> is the part of the file
before the .cpp.  For example,

  make test_connected_components
  
will build the test of the connected components algorithm located in
test_connected_components.cpp.


2. Qthreads

Sandia's Qthreads library allows the MTGL to be run using multiple threads
on non-XMT systems.

2.1 Get the Software

Download the latest Qthreads library from its webpage,
https://code.google.com/p/qthreads/.  These instructions assume you are
using Qthreads version 1.5 or later.

2.2 Installing Qthreads

Before using MTGL with Qthreads, the library needs to be installed.
Qthreads follows the standard installation method of Unix-like systems.
For those unfamiliar with this, the short version is to issue the following
commands from the directory where you unzipped Qthreads:

  ./configure --prefix=<qthread_install_dir>
  make
  make install

If you are an administrator and want to install in the default location
(/usr/local), then don't include the '--prefix' option.  If you need more
help read the INSTALL file included with Qthreads.

2.3 Configure the MTGL to Use Qthreads

Once Qthreads is built and installed, you can configure the MTGL library
to use it.

From the MTGL trunk, run 'autoreconf -ifs' if you haven't already.  Next,
run configure with the following options:

  ./configure --with-qthreads[=qthreads_install_dir]

If you installed Qthreads in the default directory, you don't need to
include '=qthreads_install_dir'.  Otherwise, give the directory in which
you installed Qthreads.
