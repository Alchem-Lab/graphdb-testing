    \brief Revised version of the graph filter algorithm that filters a graph
           based on the edge properties of a target graph.

    \author Greg Mackey (gemacke@sandia.gov)

    \date 7/2008

    Each edge in the original graph is compared against the edges in the
    target graph.  If the original edge matches any edge in the target graph
    based on the match described in the filter function object, then that
    edge is kept.  Otherwise, it is thrown away.  Then, an edge induced
    subgraph of the original graph, created from the matching edges, is
    returned.

    The algorithm takes a function object that defines the comparison made
    for the filter.  A default comparator is provided (f_default_comparator),
    but a user can define their own.  The only restriction is that the
    () operator needs to take the same paramters as in f_default_comparator.

    This algorithm visits edges based on DIRECTED travel.  From a vertex
    in a directed or bidirectional graph, all out edges are visited.  The
    result for a directed and a bidirectional graph should be the same when
    the algorithm is run in serial.  From a vertex in an undirected graph,
    all adjacent edges are visited which means that the comparator is called
    twice for each edge where each endpoint gets a chance to be the "source".

/*! \brief Default comparison function object that determines if an edge from
           the big graph matches the given edge from the target graph.

  This function object checks if the type of the edge and the types of the
  source and target vertices from the big graph match those of the currently
  considered target graph edge.  For directed and bidirectional graphs, the
  comparator is called once for each edge.  For undirected graphs the
  comparator is called twice for each edge where each endpoint gets a chance
  to be the "source".

  The comparator function object is passed as a parameter to
  filter_graph_by_edges().  Thus, the user can define their own comparator
  function object to customize the matching.  The only requirement is that
  the definition of operator() must be identical to the one in the default
  comparator.
