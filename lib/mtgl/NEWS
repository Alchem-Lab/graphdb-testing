----- 1.1.1 -----
New Features:
 - Added accumulate_out_degree() and accumulate_in_degree() to simplify manual
   manhattan partitioning.
Improvements:
 - Functions in partioning.hpp are now in the MTGL namespace.
 - Configure now supports --with-openmp option.
Bugfixes:
 - Bug in has_eulerian_circuit() where a loop used the wrong bounds.
 - SIZEOF_ macros now always defined only once.
 - Bug in read_dimacs() where one loop wasn't parallelized on the XMT.
 - Bug where test harness didn't completely support OpenMP.
 - Memory leak in Qthreads and OpenMP implmentation of sort().

----- 1.1 -----
New Features:
 - Added 1D block and 2D manhattan manual partitioning functions.
 - Added a thread iterator interface to the graphs.
 - Added an implementation of STINGER and an MTGL adapter for it.
 - Added a parallelized Qthreads and OpenMP sort.
 - Added algorithm.hpp  and numeric.hpp to provide some functionality of the
   STL equivalents.  Only a few algorithms are currently supported.
 - Added an implementation of the Edmonds-Karp max-flow algorithm.
 - Added the badrank algorithm.
 - Added duplicate_euler_tour() to simplify getting an euler tour through a
   non-eulerian graph.
Improvements:
 - Got rid of get_vertex() and get_edge() as they duplicated functionality
   already available in the interface.
 - Got rid of other() as it does not fit with the BGL manner of iteration.
 - Improved scaling of triangles algorithm on the UV in certain situations.
 - Compressed_sparse_row_graph now supports Qthreads and OpenMP.
 - Parallelized the write_*() family of functions.
 - Renamed the hash structure's range_iterator to thread_iterator to match
   the name used with graphs.
 - Updated the make process to be more standard and added a couple of targets.
 - Updated the test harness to support OpenMP and specifying the number of
   threads for Qthreads and OpenMP.
 - Refactored the following interfaces:
   - badrank
   - breadth first search
   - euler tour
   - independent set
   - pagerank
   - random walk
   - subgraph isomorphism
 - Updated the following algorithms to use the new thread iterators and
   partitioning scheme: 
    - badrank
    - breadth first search
    - connected components
    - independent set
    - pagerank
    - pseudo diameter
    - vertex betweenness
 - Updated the following algorithms to not require vertices and edges to have
   ids:
    - badrank
    - breadth first search
    - pagerank
    - pseudo diameter
    - vertex betweenness
 - Updated the following algorithms to support Qthreads:
    - badrank
    - breadth first search
    - pagerank
    - pseudo diameter
    - vertex betweenness
Bugfixes:
 - Several bugs related to using dynamic_array compiled with bounds checking
   enabled.
 - Independent set no longer dies on the XMT.
 - Initializing subgraphs on Windows now works.
 - All test now build on the XMT, Linux, and OS X.
 - Got rid of several memory leaks.

----- 1.0 -----
First release of MTGL.
